# Co-Build Log

Append student decisions, AI assistance, manual verification, and learning evidence by unit.

## S01 (2026-08-19)
- Student decisions: selected the balanced global ten-economy panel and confirmed all four research-question lenses (RQ1-RQ4); RQ3 scoped as a case study.
- AI assistance: drafted `src/macropulse/scope.py` (locked scope module), `tests/test_scope.py` (16 tests: normal/boundary/missing/invalid), `docs/ResearchScope.md`, and evidence.
- Manual verification: student reviewed concern list (plaintext API key in local setup scripts, uncommitted .gitignore, broken editable install) before unit start.
- Learning evidence: diagnosed why `python -m macropulse.smoke` failed while pytest passed (Anaconda Python 3.13.14 skips `.pth` files carrying the macOS `hidden` BSD flag; a local process re-applies the flag to `.venv`). Recorded as an E01 defect with `PYTHONPATH=src` workaround.
